    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Global Risk Index registers 70.0, with a velocity of -0.7, driven primarily by Geopolitical Conflict Intensity at 95.4. The critical alert highlights escalating Western sanctions severely impacting Russia\u2019s oil sector. This aggressive financial maneuver, aimed at crippling revenue streams, is forcing unprecedented re-routing of global crude flows.\n\nThis directly cascades into stressed maritime logistics, increasing transit times and insurance premiums for tankers (Trade: 79.1). Energy markets (Energy: 42.2) grapple with sustained volatility as traditional supply chains fracture, compelling nations to seek alternative, often costlier, sources. Diplomatically, these sanctions deepen the geopolitical chasm, limiting avenues for de-escalation while strengthening blocs aligned against perceived aggressors. The strategic weaponization of economic policy is demonstrably reshaping global commerce and international relations.",
