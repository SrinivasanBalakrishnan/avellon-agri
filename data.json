    "AI_Brief": "The world teeters on the brink of deeper instability, marked by an AGRI score of 74.3 and a velocity of +0.9, driven primarily by escalating Geopolitical Conflict Intensity (100). The \"new face of conflict\" is vividly playing out in protracted crises like Sudan\u2019s civil war and the four-year war in Ukraine, as highlighted by Vision of Humanity and Foreign Policy. This intense geopolitical friction is rapidly cascading into economic warfare. Recent moves, such as Trump\u2019s new sanctions on Russian oil giants and discussions among G7 finance ministers for further tariffs, are intensifying Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation (92.1). This directly impacts Russia\u2019s oil sector, according to Russia.Post, fueling broader Energy & Maritime Disruption (42.2) and threatening global supply lines. The very nature of warfare is shifting, with \"Sanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation\" becoming the \"new warfare,\" a sentiment echoed by Modern Diplomacy and China's own \"sanctions gambit\" in the second trade war, pushing Trade & Supply Chain Stress to a critical 80.2. This complex web of overt conflict and economic coercion, reminiscent of Niall Ferguson\u2019s \"Cold War Two,\" creates a volatile environment where global markets struggle to evade disaster, even as underlying pressures from Cyber & Infrastructure Threats (70.6) and an extreme Climate & Resource Shock (100) persist, defining a new era of systemic chaos.",

    "Pillar_Narratives": {
        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "The global landscape is defined by extreme conflict intensity, scoring 100, exemplified by 'Sudan\u2019s civil war amid a fragmented geopolitical order' and the 'Four Years of War in Europe' noted by Vision of Humanity and Foreign Policy. These protracted conflicts underscore a volatile environment where traditional and economic warfare converge.",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "While currently at 42.2, the potential for significant disruption is high as 'Trump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants' and G7 finance ministers discuss further measures. These actions directly impact 'Russia\u2019s Oil Sector,' as detailed by Russia.Post, creating persistent market uncertainty.",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "Trade & Supply Chain Stress remains critically high at 80.2, driven by the expanding use of economic coercion. The phenomenon of 'Sanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation' as 'the New Warfare,' per Modern Diplomacy, coupled with 'China\u2019s Sanctions Gambit' cited by AEI, demonstrates the pervasive nature of these stresses.",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "Sovereign Financial Stress registers at 55.0, reflecting the indirect economic fallout from heightened geopolitical tensions. The discussions by G7 finance ministers regarding 'possible sanctions, tariffs on supporters of Russia's war' (Reuters) introduce uncertainty that could pressure national finances globally, as indicated by U.S. Bank on the 'impact on global markets'.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "At 45.0, Currency & Liquidity Pressure is influenced by the broad economic implications of the current geopolitical environment. The general 'geopolitical conflict and its impact on global markets' (U.S. Bank) suggests that escalating tensions and trade wars create an unstable backdrop for currency stability and liquidity.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "This pillar stands at a critical 92.1, explicitly driven by a flurry of new measures. 'Trump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants' (NPR, NYT) and 'G7 finance ministers discuss possible sanctions, tariffs' (Reuters) illustrate a rapidly fragmenting regulatory landscape where economic tools are weaponized.",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "While specific incidents are not detailed in today's headlines, the high score of 70.6 for Cyber & Infrastructure Threats reflects the persistent and elevated risk in the increasingly 'fragmented geopolitical order' identified by Vision of Humanity. This environment naturally breeds conditions for state-backed and non-state actors to exploit digital vulnerabilities.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "Despite the absence of specific climate-related events in today's news brief, the extreme score of 100 for Climate & Resource Shock signifies an enduring, critical systemic vulnerability. This maximal rating serves as a constant backdrop, exacerbating other global risks and demonstrating a persistent, unmitigated threat to stability."
