    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Global Risk Index (AGRI) now registers 79.1, accelerating by +3.9 points, primarily due to Geopolitical Conflict Intensity at a maximum of 100. This unrelenting tension directly translates into tangible operational shifts for global enterprises. The $7 billion overhaul of Elevance Health\u2019s supply chain exemplifies this systemic de-risking. Major healthcare providers, once focused on lean global models, are now compelled to undertake costly and complex reconfigurations, prioritizing resilience against geopolitical shockwaves. This isn't just an economic decision; it\u2019s a strategic imperative to insulate critical deliveries from volatile trade routes and potential national-level disruptions, underscoring \"Trade\" at 100.0. The cascading effect is palpable across industries: increased logistics lead times, higher procurement expenses, and a rapid pivot towards regionalized sourcing. Such large-scale re-orientation reveals how geopolitical friction is fundamentally reshaping global commerce and demanding proactive, defensive operational planning.",
