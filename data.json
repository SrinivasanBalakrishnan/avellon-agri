    "AI_Brief": "The global geopolitical landscape is rapidly crystallizing into an era defined by profound conflict and economic warfare, pushing the 'Geopolitical Conflict Intensity' to a critical 100. From 'Sudan\u2019s civil war amid a fragmented geopolitical order' (Vision of Humanity) to the 'Four Years of War in Europe' (Foreign Policy), direct military engagements are fracturing international stability. This escalating conflict is the primary driver of a cascading economic fallout. Trump's renewed 'sanctions on Russian oil giants' (NPR, NYT) are intensifying an 'economic war' (Atlantic Council), leading to significant 'Energy & Maritime Disruption' and fueling 'Trade & Supply Chain Stress' (Modern Diplomacy). As the G7 considers further 'sanctions, tariffs on supporters of Russia's war' (Reuters), 'Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation' surges to 90.8, creating a complex, uncertain operating environment for global businesses. This 'Cold War Two' (WEF) scenario means that every political decision, from trade barriers to energy policies, carries the potential for far-reaching, disruptive consequences, forcing executives to navigate an increasingly fragmented and hostile world where economic tools are weaponized, and the very fabric of global commerce is under siege.",

    "Pillar_Narratives": {
        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "The 'Geopolitical Conflict Intensity' score stands at 100, reflecting a severe global landscape marked by escalating direct military engagements. This is vividly illustrated by 'Sudan\u2019s civil war amid a fragmented geopolitical order,' as reported by Vision of Humanity, alongside the continued 'Four Years of War in Europe' noted by Foreign Policy.",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "Despite a moderate score of 42.2, significant 'Energy & Maritime Disruption' is emerging from intensified economic warfare targeting major producers. The New York Times reports 'Trump\u2019s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector Ratchet Up Economic War,' signaling potential shifts in global energy flows and maritime routes for crucial commodities.",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "The high 'Trade & Supply Chain Stress' score of 80.2 highlights the increasing use of economic measures as tools of conflict. Modern Diplomacy's analysis, 'Sanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation: Are Trade Wars the New Warfare?,' underscores how these actions are creating significant friction and uncertainty across global supply chains.",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "Amidst a 'Sovereign Financial Stress' score of 50.8, nations face growing fiscal pressures from intensified economic warfare. Reuters indicates 'G7 finance ministers discuss possible sanctions, tariffs on supporters of Russia's war,' suggesting potential financial fallout for countries caught in geopolitical crosshairs.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "With a 'Currency & Liquidity Pressure' score of 45.0, the broader economic conflict framework suggests underlying vulnerabilities. The increasing use of 'economic coercion in the Second Trade War' by entities like China, as analyzed by AEI, hints at the potential for future currency instability and liquidity tightening in targeted economies.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "The extremely high 'Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation' score of 90.8 reflects an intensifying global regime of economic warfare. NPR details 'Trump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants in a push to end Ukraine war,' showcasing a growing trend of unilateral and multilateral punitive measures creating a fractured regulatory environment.",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "The 'Cyber & Infrastructure Threats' score of 70.6 implies a heightened risk environment inherent to an era defined by 'Cold War Two' (The World Economic Forum), where geopolitical conflicts naturally elevate the risk of asymmetric digital warfare targeting critical infrastructure, even if specific incidents are not highlighted in current reports.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "The extreme 'Climate & Resource Shock' score of 100 indicates a severe underlying vulnerability, subtly reinforced by analyses like The Economist's 'War, geopolitics, energy crisis: how the economy evades every disaster,' acknowledging an ongoing energy crisis that directly impacts resource stability alongside broader climate risks."
