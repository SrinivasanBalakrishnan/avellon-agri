    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Global Risk Index registers 70.7, advancing with a +0.7 velocity, driven by escalating geopolitical conflict intensity (96.7). The latest priority alert highlights the profound impact of Western sanctions on Russia\u2019s oil sector, an event with immediate cascading effects.\n\nSanction-induced disruptions are compelling Russia to reroute substantial crude volumes, primarily by sea, to Asia. This logistical shift is straining global tanker fleets, driving up charter rates, and increasing transit times significantly. Ports capable of handling these redirected shipments face mounting congestion and operational complexities. Diplomatically, Moscow's search for new buyers and methods to circumvent restrictions intensifies friction, while sanctioning nations grapple with market stability and compliance enforcement. This geopolitical friction directly fuels energy price volatility and introduces profound uncertainties into global trade networks.",
