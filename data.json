    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Global Risk Index (AGRI) stands at 59.5 with a velocity of -2.6, indicating a deteriorating risk environment. The primary driver is the accelerating 'Climate & Resource Shock' pillar, currently at 80.0. This first-order effect is projected to exacerbate energy market volatility (Energy: 42.2) through disruptions to production, distribution, and increased demand for climate-resilient infrastructure.\n\nSustained energy price inflation and escalating climate-related expenditures are anticipated to amplify sovereign fiscal strain (Sovereign: 55.0). This could elevate public debt levels and increase borrowing costs, constraining fiscal space. Consequently, a weakened sovereign balance sheet and persistent inflationary pressures stemming from resource scarcity are likely to exert further depreciatory pressure on the currency (Currency: 45.0), potentially inducing capital outflow. The interconnected feedback loops across these pillars warrant close monitoring.",
