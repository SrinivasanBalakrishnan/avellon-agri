    "AI_Brief": "The global landscape continues its descent into a \"Cold War Two\" era, marked by a critical AGRI of 70.3 and persistent geopolitical conflict intensity, currently peaking at 100. The world grapples with a fragmented geopolitical order where \"the new face of conflict\" is increasingly defined by proxy wars and economic weaponization. Sudan's civil war, for instance, isn't just internal strife but a brutal contest fueled by \"the geopolitics of resources,\" as highlighted by Eurasia Review, mirroring broader international power struggles. Western efforts to curb Russia's aggression through \"sanctions, tariffs, and retaliation\" are themselves evolving into a form of \"economic warfare,\" according to The Guardian and Modern Diplomacy. However, the effectiveness of these measures is debatable, with reports from asahi.com revealing \"foreign cars flow to Russia through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions.\" This demonstrates the growing porosity of global supply chains and the challenges in enforcing a unified front, leading to profound \"trade and supply chain stress.\" The cascading effects impact global markets, as U.S. Bank notes, forcing executives to navigate a complex web where traditional warfare intertwines with economic coercion, driving significant \"sanctions and regulatory fragmentation.\" The global economy, despite appearing to \"evade every disaster\" (The Economist), is undoubtedly feeling the strain of these prolonged, multifaceted conflicts.",

        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "At a critical score of 100, conflict is reshaping the global order. Sudan\u2019s civil war exemplifies \"the new face of conflict\" within a \"fragmented geopolitical order,\" as noted by Vision of Humanity. The four years of war in Europe, discussed by Foreign Policy, further underscore this pervasive intensity.",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "Despite sanctions, Russia's oil sector continues to adapt, with \"How the War and Latest Western Sanctions Are Impacting Russia\u2019s Oil Sector\" (Russia.Post) detailing persistent challenges but also resilience. Trump's \"new sanctions on Russian oil giants\" (NPR) further escalate the economic pressure, yet global energy flows remain complex.",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "Global supply chains are under severe pressure, evidenced by \"foreign cars flow to Russia through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions\" (asahi.com). This highlights the ineffectiveness of some sanctions and the proliferation of \"trade wars as the new warfare,\" as Modern Diplomacy reports.",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "The extensive use of sanctions and the ongoing \"economic warfare\" (The Guardian) places significant strain on national economies. Geopolitical conflict and its broader economic impact, as discussed by U.S. Bank, invariably contribute to sovereign financial vulnerabilities.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "The persistent \"economic warfare\" through sanctions, as detailed by The Guardian, and broader geopolitical instability outlined by The World Economic Forum's \"Cold War Two\" narrative, inherently introduce uncertainty. This environment generates pressures on global currencies and liquidity as capital flows react to increased risk.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "The proliferation of sanctions has created a highly fragmented regulatory landscape, with \"Trump\u2019s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector\" (The New York Times) and \"China\u2019s Sanctions Gambit\" (AEI) demonstrating their use as formal and informal economic coercion. \"Sanctions are not a humane alternative to bombs. They are economic warfare,\" declares The Guardian, emphasizing their strategic role.",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "The emerging \"new face of conflict\" (Vision of Humanity) and the strategic use of \"economic warfare\" (The Guardian) highlight the expanding domains of geopolitical friction. While not explicitly detailed in the provided headlines, these evolving forms of confrontation inherently extend to non-traditional arenas, including cyber tactics and threats to critical infrastructure, as integral elements of modern statecraft.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "Resource competition is a significant driver of conflict, with \"Kordofan And Blue Nile\u2019s Quiet Battles: The Geopolitics Of Resources Behind Sudan\u2019s Civil War\" (Eurasia Review) explicitly linking local conflicts to resource geopolitics. This demonstrates how environmental and resource pressures exacerbate geopolitical instability."
