    "AI_Brief": "The Global Risk Index (AGRI) stands at 62.8, with an accelerating velocity of +0.7, signaling a worsening systemic risk environment. The primary driver is Climate & Resource Shock, underscored by a Climate Risk score of 75.\n\nThis sustained climate volatility is expected to trigger significant second-order effects. Resource scarcity and extreme weather events will likely exacerbate supply chain disruptions, driving inflationary pressures and heightening food insecurity. Furthermore, increased competition for diminished resources could intensify geopolitical tensions and drive migration. The notable Currency Risk (45) suggests that climate-induced economic disruptions, such as agricultural losses or infrastructure damage, could precipitate exchange rate volatility, capital flight, and sovereign fiscal stress, particularly in vulnerable economies, potentially fostering broader financial instability.",
