    "AI_Brief": "The global risk landscape is acutely volatile, with the Avellon Geopolitical Risk Index at 71.7, driven overwhelmingly by \"Geopolitical Conflict Intensity\" at a perfect 100. The world is navigating a new, fragmented geopolitical order, marked by prolonged conflicts like the four-year war in Europe and Sudan's civil war, which is increasingly tied to the geopolitics of resources, as highlighted by Vision of Humanity and Eurasia Review. This intense conflict environment has normalized \"economic warfare\" \u2013 a concept echoed by The Guardian and Modern Diplomacy \u2013 manifest in expansive sanctions regimes. Western sanctions are profoundly impacting Russia\u2019s oil sector, yet pathways like foreign cars flowing to Russia through China (\u671d\u65e5\u65b0\u805e) expose the porous nature and challenges of enforcing these measures, creating regulatory fragmentation (score 92.1).\n\nThis environment of active conflict and economic coercion translates directly into \"Trade & Supply Chain Stress\" (score 80.3) and \"Energy & Maritime Disruption\" (score 42.2), even as \"The Economist\" notes the economy's surprising resilience to disaster. The New York Times and NPR underscore Trump's new sanctions on Russian oil, further ratcheting up this economic struggle. The geopolitical churn, which Niall Ferguson describes as \"Cold War Two,\" means businesses face not just military but economic battlegrounds, where tariffs, sanctions, and retaliatory measures reshape global commerce and elevate the risk of financial instability. This pervasive state of economic friction and conflict dictates that executives must anticipate constant disruption and adapt to a world where geopolitical factors fundamentally dictate market dynamics.",

        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "\u201cGeopolitical Conflict Intensity\u201d stands at an alarming 100, reflecting a deeply fractured global order. This is evident in reports like Vision of Humanity's analysis of \u201cSudan\u2019s civil war amid a fragmented geopolitical order\u201d and Foreign Policy's observation of \u201cFour Years of War in Europe.\u201d",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "Despite a moderate score of 42.2, the energy sector remains a key leverage point in geopolitical conflicts. Reports from Russia.Post detail \u201cHow the War and Latest Western Sanctions Are Impacting Russia\u2019s Oil Sector,\u201d while NPR confirms \u201cTrump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants.\u201d",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "At a high 80.3, \u201cTrade & Supply Chain Stress\u201d is acute, driven by the weaponization of economic policy. This is underscored by Modern Diplomacy asking if \u201cSanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation: Are Trade Wars the New Warfare?\u201d, and evidence of fragmented global trade routes with \u201cForeign cars flow to Russia through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions\u201d (\u671d\u65e5\u65b0\u805e).",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "With a score of 55.0, \u201cSovereign Financial Stress\u201d is a growing concern as geopolitical tensions spill into global markets. U.S. Bank highlights the \u201cGeopolitical conflict and its impact on global markets,\u201d indicating that widespread instability inevitably strains national finances.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "While scoring 45.0, \u201cCurrency & Liquidity Pressure\u201d exists as a secondary effect of the intense geopolitical climate. Although not explicitly detailed in headlines, the broader \u201cimpact on global markets\u201d cited by U.S. Bank from geopolitical conflict creates underlying currency volatility and liquidity concerns.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "This pillar is critically high at 92.1, showcasing the widespread use and complex nature of economic coercion. The Guardian's statement that \u201cSanctions are not a humane alternative to bombs. They are economic warfare\u201d exemplifies the current strategy, further complicated by foreign companies skirting \u201cUkraine war sanctions\u201d via China (\u671d\u65e5\u65b0\u805e).",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "\u201cCyber & Infrastructure Threats\u201d stand at 70.3. While no specific cyber headlines were provided, the extreme level of \u201cGeopolitical Conflict Intensity\u201d (score 100) inherently elevates the risk of state-sponsored cyber warfare and critical infrastructure targeting, as often seen in modern conflicts.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "With a high score of 80, \u201cClimate & Resource Shock\u201d is increasingly intertwined with geopolitical instability. Eurasia Review explicitly links conflict to resources, noting \u201cThe Geopolitics Of Resources Behind Sudan\u2019s Civil War,\u201d demonstrating how scarcity and competition fuel disputes and instability globally."
