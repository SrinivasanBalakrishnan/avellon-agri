    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Global Risk Index (AGRI) currently registers 59.5, with a decelerating velocity of -2.6. Despite this minor aggregate decline, the pronounced rise of Climate & Resource Shock as the top pillar, underpinned by Climate Risk at 80, signals a significant shift in risk composition.\n\nThis trend portends escalating resource scarcity and persistent supply chain disruptions, with second-order effects expected across multiple domains. Elevated climate-related events will likely amplify Sovereign Risk (55.0) through increased fiscal burdens from disaster response and adaptation. Concurrently, disruptions to resource availability and infrastructure could further stress Energy Risk (42.2) via demand-supply imbalances. Furthermore, Currency Risk (45.0) remains exposed to potential volatility from trade imbalances and capital shifts driven by climate impacts, indicating a complex interplay where declining aggregate risk masks intensifying structural challenges.",
