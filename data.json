    "AI_Brief": "AGRI stands at 70.0, with velocity at +0.8, driven primarily by escalating Geopolitical Conflict Intensity (95.4). The latest Western sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s oil sector, detailed in a recent Russia.Post alert, are creating immediate and severe cascading effects. Russia\u2019s capacity to reroute vast quantities of crude and refined products is increasingly constrained by limitations on maritime insurance, tanker availability, and financial transaction processing.\n\nThis disruption extends beyond direct trade, inflating global shipping costs as vessels navigate longer, more complex routes and avoid perceived risk zones. The subsequent tightening of energy supply, even as alternative sources are sought, contributes to price volatility and fuels diplomatic friction among nations dependent on stable oil markets. This complex interplay of sanctions, logistical hurdles, and energy market uncertainty elevates the broader risk profile.",
