    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Geopolitical Risk Index (AGRI) sits at a critical 73.1, accelerating by +1.9, propelled primarily by escalating Geopolitical Conflict Intensity. The world is grappling with a new, fragmented geopolitical order, marked by conflicts like Sudan's civil war and the protracted \"Four Years of War in Europe\" according to Foreign Policy. This era is defined by the pervasive use of economic warfare, with Western sanctions on Russia's oil sector intensifying, as highlighted by The New York Times, and the EU introducing new tariffs on Israel. The expansion of these \"trade wars,\" as Modern Diplomacy notes, includes China's strategic economic coercion, fostering a 'Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation' that chokes global trade and supply chains. This complex interplay of active conflicts, energy market disruptions, and punitive economic measures is not merely abstract; it directly fuels an energy crisis, strains national finances, and introduces significant 'Currency & Liquidity Pressure,' creating a perilous operating environment that visionary historian Niall Ferguson aptly describes as 'Cold War Two,' forcing executives to navigate unprecedented systemic risks.",

    "Pillar_Narratives": {
        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "Geopolitical conflict is at an all-time high, with a score of 100, driven by the emergence of a 'new face of conflict' seen in civil wars like Sudan's, as reported by Vision of Humanity. The ongoing 'Four Years of War in Europe,' highlighted by Foreign Policy, further underscores the persistent and pervasive nature of global hostilities.",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "Despite a lower score of 42.2, significant 'Energy & Maritime Disruption' is evident, primarily due to intensifying economic warfare. The impact of 'Latest Western Sanctions Are Impacting Russia\u2019s Oil Sector,' according to Russia.Post, directly threatens global energy supply stability and pricing.",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "Trade and supply chains are under immense pressure at a score of 80.2, reflecting a landscape where 'Sanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation: Are Trade Wars the New Warfare?' as Modern Diplomacy asks. This is further compounded by instances like 'China\u2019s Sanctions Gambit: Formal and Informal Economic Coercion,' detailed by AEI, fragmenting global commerce.",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "Sovereign financial stress, though at 55.0, is a growing concern, intrinsically linked to the broader 'economic war.' The financial implications of 'Trump\u2019s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector' reported by The New York Times, create fiscal headwinds for sanctioned nations and ripple effects for their trading partners.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "At 45.0, 'Currency & Liquidity Pressure' is a subtle but significant concern, as 'Geopolitical conflict and its impact on global markets,' noted by U.S. Bank, invariably translates into capital flight and currency volatility. The pervasive use of sanctions and trade friction exacerbates this instability.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "This pillar is extremely high at 92.9, underscoring the rapid escalation of punitive economic measures globally. 'EU lays out new tariffs and sanctions on Israel over war in Gaza,' as reported by PBS, alongside 'Trump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants,' per NPR, highlight a proliferating and fragmenting regulatory landscape.",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "Cyber and infrastructure threats score 70.5, driven by the strategic competition inherent in a 'Tech Cold War: The Geopolitics of Technology,' as discussed by the Stimson Center. This environment fosters state-sponsored cyber espionage and potential attacks on critical infrastructure as a dimension of geopolitical rivalry.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "With a high score of 90, 'Climate & Resource Shock' is severe, manifesting through direct and indirect impacts of geopolitical turmoil. The 'War, geopolitics, energy crisis,' as articulated by The Economist, directly links conflicts to resource scarcity and price shocks, particularly in energy markets."
