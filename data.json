    "AI_Brief": "The global geopolitical landscape is rapidly fragmenting, pushing the Avellon Geopolitical Risk Index to 74.1. The relentless 'Geopolitical Conflict Intensity,' a top driver, is manifesting across multiple theaters, from the 'four years of war in Europe' to Sudan's civil war, highlighting a 'new face of conflict,' as Vision of Humanity describes. This intense kinetic and proxy warfare is profoundly intertwined with escalating economic conflict. Trump's 'new sanctions on Russian oil giants,' reported by NPR and The New York Times, signify a deliberate ratcheting up of 'economic warfare,' further disrupting energy markets already under strain. This weaponization of finance and trade, where 'sanctions are not a humane alternative to bombs,' according to The Guardian, fuels 'Trade & Supply Chain Stress.' While China facilitates 'foreign cars flow to Russia through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions,' indicating a complex regulatory landscape. Such strategic maneuvering and circumvention contribute to a 'fragmented geopolitical order' and a persistent 'Cold War Two' dynamic, ensuring cascading impacts on global markets, energy stability, and the very structure of international trade, demanding executive attention to navigate this volatile new era.",

    "Pillar_Narratives": {
        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "Geopolitical conflict remains acute, driven by 'four years of war in Europe' (Foreign Policy) and 'Sudan\u2019s civil war amid a fragmented geopolitical order' (Vision of Humanity). The 'Oil, Missiles and Power: The Geopolitics of the Iran-Israel Conflict' (TRENDS Research & Advisory) further underlines a highly volatile global security environment, reflected in its score of 100.",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "The energy sector faces heightened disruption following 'Trump\u2019s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector' (The New York Times). These new measures, aimed at shifting the Ukraine war dynamics as noted by the Atlantic Council, contribute to an 'energy crisis' (The Economist) that significantly impacts global supply and pricing, despite the current score of 42.2.",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "Global trade is under significant duress, with a high score of 79.8, as 'Sanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation' emerge as 'the new warfare' (Modern Diplomacy). This stress is exacerbated by 'China\u2019s Sanctions Gambit' (AEI) and reports of 'foreign cars flow to Russia through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions' (Reuters), highlighting efforts to bypass restrictions and fragment trade flows.",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "Sovereign financial stability is moderately stressed at a score of 55.0, as 'geopolitical conflict and its impact on global markets' (U.S. Bank) create widespread uncertainty. The ongoing economic warfare and trade disruptions contribute to a challenging environment for national treasuries.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "Currency and liquidity pressures register a score of 45.0, reflecting underlying market sensitivity to the broader geopolitical climate. The 'impact on global markets' from persistent conflict, as noted by U.S. Bank, continues to exert pressure on financial flows and currency valuations.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "Sanctions and regulatory fragmentation are extremely high at 90.8, with 'Trump\u2019s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector' (The New York Times) intensifying 'economic warfare' (The Guardian). The strategic debate over 'secondary tariffs or tighter sanctions' (Russia Matters) and the observable 'foreign cars flow to Russia through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions' (Reuters) underscore a highly complex and fragmented regulatory landscape.",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "Cyber and infrastructure threats score high at 69.8, indicating significant underlying risk. In a 'fragmented geopolitical order' (Vision of Humanity) marked by escalating 'economic warfare' (The Guardian), the potential for state-sponsored cyber incursions and targeting of critical infrastructure remains a persistent concern for executives.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "The 'Climate & Resource Shock' pillar shows maximum intensity with a score of 100. While not explicitly detailed in recent headlines, this data point signals extreme and persistent systemic pressure on global resources and environmental stability, representing a foundational vulnerability in the geopolitical risk landscape."
