    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Global Risk Index (AGRI) climbed to 72.4, driven primarily by an unprecedented Geopolitical Conflict Intensity score of 100. This escalation is acutely manifest in Sudan, where the ongoing civil war, today's highest priority global alert, deepens its grip amid a fragmented international response. The conflict's protracted nature, fueled by a fractured geopolitical order, is creating severe regional instability.\n\nLogistically, critical humanitarian aid convoys face near-insurmountable obstacles, disrupting supply chains for essential goods across East Africa and straining resources in bordering nations. Diplomatically, the crisis reveals the limits of multilateral engagement, with external actors increasingly backing proxy factions, rather than pursuing unified peace efforts. While Sudan itself isn't a major energy producer, the regional destabilization further fuels uncertainty in already volatile commodity markets, pushing global energy prices upwards. This complex interplay of internal strife and external inaction directly accounts for today's +2.4 velocity, indicating a worsening global risk landscape.",
