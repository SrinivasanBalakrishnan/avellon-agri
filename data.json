    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Global Risk Index registers 70.0, propelled by escalating Geopolitical Conflict Intensity at 96.7. Today\u2019s top alert details the profound impact of Western sanctions on Russia\u2019s oil sector, a direct consequence of the ongoing war. This economic warfare immediately stresses global energy markets (42.2). As traditional buyers seek alternatives, a complex logistical realignment is underway: tanker fleets reroute, increasing transit times and demand for compliant shipping, while insurance premiums for certain routes skyrocket. This not only inflates trade costs (77.9) but also complicates global supply chains for related commodities. Diplomatically, the sanctions solidify adversarial blocs, forcing nations to make difficult energy security choices and deepening international fissures. This deliberate weaponization of a vital resource continues to ripple through markets, ensuring sustained geopolitical friction and elevated systemic risk.",
