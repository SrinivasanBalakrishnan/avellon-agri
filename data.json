    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Global Risk Index (AGRI) currently stands at 63.4, exhibiting a positive velocity of +1.3, indicating an accelerating risk environment. The primary driver of this upward trend is the 'Climate & Resource Shock' pillar, reflecting a high Climate Risk score of 80.\n\nThis elevation is anticipated to generate significant second-order effects. Persistent climate-related disruptions, including resource scarcity and supply chain vulnerabilities, will likely exacerbate economic instability. These pressures, stemming from impacts on agricultural output, infrastructure, and trade balances, are poised to directly influence fiscal health and investor sentiment. Consequently, the observed Currency Risk of 45.0 is projected to face heightened volatility and depreciation pressures as national economies contend with the direct and indirect costs of climate adaptation and resource reallocation.",
