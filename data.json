    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Global Risk Index (AGRI) stands at 72.4 with zero velocity, indicating a persistently high risk environment. The primary driver of this elevated state is Geopolitical Conflict Intensity, currently at an extreme level of 100. This is critically underscored by the highest priority global alert highlighting Sudan's civil war as a prime example of the new face of conflict within a highly fragmented geopolitical order. This scenario reflects a pervasive challenge where regional instability, fueled by complex internal and external dynamics, poses significant systemic risks. The extreme score in geopolitical conflict permeates across other risk pillars, exacerbating vulnerabilities in trade, supply chains, and regulatory landscapes, necessitating urgent and comprehensive risk mitigation strategies.",

    "Pillar_Narratives": {
        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "At an extreme level of 100, this pillar signifies a global environment marked by pervasive and severe interstate and intrastate conflicts, with critical flashpoints like Sudan demonstrating widespread instability.",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "Standing at 42.2, risk in this sector is currently moderate, although geopolitical tensions retain the potential to rapidly escalate disruptions to energy supply routes and maritime trade.",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "With a high score of 80.3, global trade networks are experiencing significant stress, likely due to a combination of geopolitical tensions, regional conflicts, and lingering structural vulnerabilities.",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "At 55.0, sovereign financial stress is moderate but warrants close monitoring, as increasing debt burdens and volatile economic conditions in various nations present growing default risks.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "At 45.0, currency and liquidity pressures are moderate, yet vulnerable to rapid shifts driven by capital outflows or central bank policy divergences, particularly in emerging markets.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "At a very high 92.1, this pillar reflects an increasingly complex and fractured regulatory landscape, characterized by proliferating sanctions regimes and diverging legal frameworks that complicate international operations.",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "With a high score of 70.3, the threat landscape for cyberattacks and critical infrastructure disruptions remains elevated, driven by state-sponsored actors and sophisticated criminal enterprises.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "At a very high 85, this indicates significant and ongoing risks from climate-related events and resource scarcity, posing long-term challenges to economic stability and human security globally."
