    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Global Risk Index (AGRI) stands at 75.2, with a velocity of -1.1, indicating sustained high systemic risk with marginal near-term de-escalation. Geopolitical Conflict Intensity is the predominant driver at 100, directly elevating Geopolitical and Trade sub-indices to 100.0, and Cyber to 90.0.\n\nSecond-order effects manifest through exacerbated supply chain fragmentation and increased logistics friction due to trade restrictions and re-shoring initiatives. This environment elevates operational costs and necessitates diversification of sourcing strategies. Concurrently, heightened state-sponsored cyber activity, directly correlated with geopolitical tensions, poses amplified threats to critical infrastructure and data integrity across interconnected networks. These dynamics collectively contribute to systemic economic volatility and increased enterprise security expenditures.",
