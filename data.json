    "AI_Brief": "The global risk landscape is teetering at an AGRI of 73.4, with a rising velocity of +0.3, primarily propelled by extreme Geopolitical Conflict Intensity (score 100). The world witnesses a new face of conflict, from Sudan's devastating civil war amid a fragmented geopolitical order (Vision of Humanity) to the \"Four Years of War in Europe\" (Foreign Policy) that now defines much of the continent. Historian Niall Ferguson warns we are entering \"Cold War Two\" (The World Economic Forum), where traditional battlefields are augmented by a relentless economic warfare.\n\nThis escalating friction manifests in a barrage of sanctions and tariffs. Trump\u2019s new sanctions on Russian oil giants (NPR, The New York Times, Atlantic Council) ratchet up the economic war, impacting Russia's oil sector (Russia.Post) and driving Energy & Maritime Disruption. G7 finance ministers are discussing further measures (Reuters), signaling deeper Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation (score 93.6). Meanwhile, China\u2019s \"Sanctions Gambit\" (AEI) exemplifies how \"Trade Wars are the New Warfare\" (Modern Diplomacy), contributing to significant Trade & Supply Chain Stress (score 80.2). These multifaceted pressures on markets, supply chains, and sovereign finances create a volatile environment, forcing economies to evade \"every disaster\" (The Economist) in a deeply interconnected, yet increasingly hostile, world.",

        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "Global geopolitical conflict remains at an extreme intensity, with Sudan's civil war highlighting the \"new face of conflict amid a fragmented geopolitical order\" (Vision of Humanity). This situation is further exacerbated by \"Four Years of War in Europe\" (Foreign Policy), underpinning a systemic rise in global tensions.",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "The energy sector faces continued disruption as \"Trump\u2019s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector Ratchet Up Economic War\" (The New York Times). These measures directly impact \"Russia\u2019s Oil Sector\" (Russia.Post), posing ongoing challenges to global supply and pricing stability.",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "Trade relations are under severe pressure, as seen with \"China\u2019s Sanctions Gambit\" (American Enterprise Institute - AEI), which contributes to \"Trade Wars are the New Warfare?\" (Modern Diplomacy). This environment of economic coercion creates significant stress across global supply chains.",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "The broader \"Geopolitical conflict and its impact on global markets\" (U.S. Bank) is creating underlying stress for sovereign finances. Discussions among \"G7 finance ministers discuss possible sanctions, tariffs on supporters of Russia's war\" (Reuters) further highlight potential financial pressures.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "The prevailing \"economic warfare\" environment, driven by sanctions and tariffs, indirectly fuels currency and liquidity pressures across global markets. As highlighted by \"Geopolitical conflict and its impact on global markets\" (U.S. Bank), escalating tensions introduce volatility and uncertainty for financial stability.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "This pillar is critically high, evidenced by \"Trump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants in a push to end Ukraine war\" (NPR). These actions, alongside discussions by \"G7 finance ministers discuss possible sanctions, tariffs on supporters of Russia's war\" (Reuters), underscore a rapidly fragmenting regulatory landscape where \"Sanctions are not a humane alternative to bombs. They are economic warfare\" (The Guardian).",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "While no specific cyber incident is cited, the intense \"economic warfare\" and the general environment of \"Cold War Two\" (The World Economic Forum) implies a significantly heightened risk landscape. Nations in conflict are increasingly likely to leverage all tools, including cyber means, against critical infrastructure.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "The global economy continues to grapple with \"War, geopolitics, energy crisis: how the economy evades every disaster\" (The Economist). This explicit mention of an \"energy crisis\" suggests ongoing resource shocks that compound the overall geopolitical instability."
