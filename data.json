    "AI_Brief": "The global risk landscape is intensifying dramatically, with the AGRI climbing to 71.7 and accelerating with a +1.4 velocity, overwhelmingly driven by an unprecedented surge in Geopolitical Conflict Intensity (100). As historian Niall Ferguson warns of an emerging \"Cold War Two,\" the \"new face of conflict\" is vividly playing out across multiple fronts. From the \"Four Years of War in Europe\" to Sudan's escalating civil war, where the \"geopolitics of resources\" fuels quiet battles in Kordofan and Blue Nile, the world is witnessing a dangerous fragmentation. This environment sees sanctions transformed into explicit \"economic warfare,\" as exemplified by the EU laying out \"new tariffs and sanctions on Israel over war in Gaza\" and renewed US efforts, with Trump leveraging \"new sanctions on Russian oil giants\" in a push to end the Ukraine war. These actions, intended to exert pressure, concurrently fragment global trade and supply chains. Evidence of this \"Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation\" (95.4) is seen in foreign cars flowing to Russia \"through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions,\" and \"China\u2019s Sanctions Gambit\" signaling a second trade war. The cascading effect is profound: while direct energy disruptions remain contained at 42.2, the pervasive use of economic tools creates significant \"Trade & Supply Chain Stress\" (77.8) and introduces pervasive financial volatility impacting global markets. Executives must navigate this increasingly weaponized and unpredictable international system, where every geopolitical move carries substantial economic repercussions.",

        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "Geopolitical conflict is at peak intensity, with the \"new face of conflict\" evident in \"Sudan\u2019s civil war amid a fragmented geopolitical order.\" This is further underscored by \"Four Years of War in Europe\" and the EU's \"new tariffs and sanctions on Israel over war in Gaza,\" signaling widespread and deepening international friction.",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "While not at peak, the sector faces significant disruption as \"Trump\u2019s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector Ratchet Up Economic War,\" directly impacting Russia\u2019s ability to export energy. These sanctions are actively shaping \"how the war and latest Western sanctions are impacting Russia\u2019s oil sector.\"",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "Stress on trade and supply chains is high, driven by the weaponization of economic policy, as \"Sanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation\" become \"the new warfare.\" This is acutely demonstrated by \"foreign cars flow to Russia through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions,\" indicating significant re-routing and complexity.",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "Sovereign financial stress is moderate but influenced by escalating geopolitical tensions, as \"geopolitical conflict and its impact on global markets\" can create instability. The consideration of \"Secondary Tariffs or Tighter Sanctions\" against Russia highlights ongoing pressures that could strain national finances.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "Currency and liquidity pressures remain moderate but are subject to volatility arising from the broader geopolitical landscape. \"Geopolitical conflict and its impact on global markets\" implies potential for currency fluctuations and shifts in liquidity as investors react to global instability.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "Sanctions and regulatory fragmentation are extremely high, characterized by an escalating \"economic warfare\" through measures like \"Trump\u2019s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector\" and the EU's \"new tariffs and sanctions on Israel.\" This is further complicated by \"China\u2019s Sanctions Gambit\" and the active circumvention efforts, such as \"foreign cars flow to Russia through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions.\"",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "The significant threat from cyber and infrastructure attacks is evident in the evolving nature of global conflict. As historian Niall Ferguson anticipates \"Cold War Two,\" the \"new face of conflict\" in a \"fragmented geopolitical order\" implicitly encompasses sophisticated digital warfare and attacks on critical infrastructure.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "Climate and resource shock remains a severe concern, intertwined with geopolitical stability, as highlighted by \"Kordofan And Blue Nile\u2019s Quiet Battles: The Geopolitics Of Resources Behind Sudan\u2019s Civil War.\" This illustrates how competition for vital resources exacerbates existing conflicts and destabilizes regions."
