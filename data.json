    "AI_Brief": "The global risk landscape is teetering on the precipice, driven predominantly by 'Geopolitical Conflict Intensity,' which stands at a critical 100. This is reflected in the AGRI score of 74.7, experiencing a +0.4 velocity. As historian Niall Ferguson observes, we are entering 'Cold War Two,' a sentiment underscored by 'Four Years of War in Europe' and new flashpoints like 'Sudan\u2019s civil war amid a fragmented geopolitical order.' The economic battlefield is expanding rapidly, with 'Sanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation' now emerging as the 'New Warfare.' 'Trump\u2019s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector' are intensifying, impacting 'Russia\u2019s Oil Sector' and contributing to ongoing 'Energy & Maritime Disruption' at 42.2. Meanwhile, 'China\u2019s Sanctions Gambit' and the 'EU lay out new tariffs and sanctions on Israel over war in Gaza' signify escalating 'Trade & Supply Chain Stress,' now at 81.0. This fragmentation and weaponization of commerce are creating immense pressure, with 'Geopolitical conflict and its impact on global markets' straining 'Sovereign Financial Stress' (55.0) and 'Currency & Liquidity Pressure' (45.0). The sheer volume of new penalties, from 'Trump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants' to the EU's actions, pushes 'Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation' to a near-max 94.4, ensuring continued global instability.",

    },
    "Pillar_Narratives": {
        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "The score of 100 reflects a deeply fragmented global order, as evidenced by 'Sudan\u2019s civil war amid a fragmented geopolitical order' (Vision of Humanity) and the grim reality of 'Four Years of War in Europe' (Foreign Policy). This sustained, high-level conflict is the top driver of global risk, pushing the AGRI higher.",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "Despite a score of 42.2, significant pressure exists due to renewed economic warfare. 'Trump\u2019s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector Ratchet Up Economic War' (The New York Times), directly impacting 'Russia\u2019s Oil Sector' (Russia.Post) and threatening global energy stability.",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "At 81.0, this pillar shows significant strain, with 'Sanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation: Are Trade Wars the New Warfare?' (Modern Diplomacy) becoming a defining characteristic. This is further exacerbated by 'China\u2019s Sanctions Gambit' (AEI) and new 'EU tariffs and sanctions on Israel over war in Gaza' (PBS).",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "The score of 55.0 points to growing fiscal vulnerabilities stemming from broader geopolitical unrest. 'Geopolitical conflict and its impact on global markets' (U.S. Bank) highlights how the pervasive 'war, geopolitics, energy crisis' (The Economist) are placing increasing strain on national financial health.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "At 45.0, currency and liquidity concerns are elevated amidst global uncertainty. The ongoing discussions among 'G7 finance ministers discuss possible sanctions, tariffs' (Reuters) and the general 'impact on global markets' (U.S. Bank) suggest continued volatility for national currencies and access to global capital.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "This pillar is extremely high at 94.4, driven by the proliferation of punitive measures. 'Trump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants' (NPR) and the 'EU lays out new tariffs and sanctions on Israel over war in Gaza' (PBS) exemplify the rapid increase in fragmented regulatory environments and the weaponization of economic tools.",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "With a score of 70.6, the risk of cyber attacks remains substantial. While no specific headlines are provided, the intensity of 'Geopolitical Conflict Intensity' (score 100) and the prevailing 'Cold War Two' (The World Economic Forum) environment inherently elevate the risk of state-sponsored cyber warfare and infrastructure targeting.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "A critical score of 100 signals severe underlying vulnerabilities. While specific climate event headlines are absent, the persistent 'energy crisis' mentioned in 'War, geopolitics, energy crisis: how the economy evades every disaster' (The Economist) underscores ongoing resource shocks that continue to challenge global stability."
