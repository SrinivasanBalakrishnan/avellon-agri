    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Global Risk Index (AGRI) registers 70.0, exhibiting a sharp -9.1 velocity today, primarily propelled by an intensified Geopolitical Conflict (96.7). The latest Western sanctions, imposed due to the ongoing conflict, are now demonstrably impacting Russia\u2019s oil sector. Reports highlight an escalating scramble for Moscow to reroute vast crude supplies, forcing reliance on obscure shipping networks and complex financial workarounds to bypass restrictions. This disruption is not isolated; it immediately strains global energy markets, driving price volatility and fundamentally altering established trade routes as shipping firms and insurers reassess risk exposure. The ripple effect amplifies logistical complexities for global commerce and keeps diplomatic channels fraught. This systemic pressure, driven by the weaponization of energy and finance, explains the sustained high AGRI, underscoring severe global interconnectedness and vulnerability.",
