    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Global Risk Index (AGRI) currently stands at an elevated 76.3, exhibiting a significant velocity increase of +16.8. This acceleration is primarily driven by Geopolitical Conflict Intensity, which registers at its maximum threshold of 100.\n\nSecond-order effects are prominently manifested across interconnected domains. Trade Risk, also at 100.0, directly reflects pervasive disruptions to global supply chains, increased protectionism, and market access constraints stemming from geopolitical friction. Cyber Risk at 90.0 indicates a substantial escalation in state-sponsored activities and espionage. While Energy Risk is 42.2, its vulnerability to further exacerbation remains high. This collective trajectory signals sustained systemic economic headwinds and amplified operational complexities across multiple sectors.",
