    "AI_Brief": "The Avellon Global Risk Index (AGRI) stands at 75.2, with zero velocity, indicating entrenched systemic risk. Today's primary driver remains extreme Geopolitical Conflict Intensity (100). Persistent regional instability and protectionist policies have elevated trade barriers (Trade 100), fundamentally reshaping global commerce. The reported US$7bn strategic shift in Elevance Health's supply chain exemplifies this profound impact.\n\nThis is not merely a corporate adjustment but a direct response to disrupted logistics, heightened shipping costs due to contested maritime routes, and the imperative for supply chain resilience over pure efficiency. The ongoing geopolitical fragmentation forces complex re-evaluation of sourcing, leading to critical delays, increased operational expenditure, and a recalibration of international dependencies. This incident highlights the cascading effects on global economic architecture, driven by sustained strategic tension.",
