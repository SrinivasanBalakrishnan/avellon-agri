    "AI_Brief": "The global geopolitical landscape teeters on the brink, with the Avellon Global Risk Index at a high 71.1, driven primarily by an unprecedented Geopolitical Conflict Intensity score of 100. This is not merely a number; it's the unfolding narrative of a world grappling with cascading crises. From the 'new face of conflict' in Sudan's civil war, fueled by the 'geopolitics of resources' (Vision of Humanity, Eurasia Review) amidst a 'fragmented geopolitical order,' to the prolonged 'Four Years of War in Europe' (Foreign Policy), direct military engagement continues to destabilize entire regions. This intense conflict rapidly morphs into widespread 'economic warfare,' as Western powers, exemplified by 'Trump\u2019s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector' (The New York Times, NPR), levy increasingly stringent sanctions. However, this strategy is double-edged, fostering 'Sanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation' (Modern Diplomacy) and leading to creative circumvention, as 'foreign cars flow to Russia through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions' (\u671d\u65e5\u65b0\u805e). This intricate web of conflict, sanctions, and evasion creates profound Trade & Supply Chain Stress (80.3), signaling that the world is indeed entering 'Cold War Two' (The World Economic Forum), where economic leverage is as potent as military might, threatening market stability globally (U.S. Bank) and challenging the resilience of economies ('how the economy evades every disaster' - The Economist).",

        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "The world faces extreme geopolitical instability, with Sudan's civil war highlighted as 'the new face of conflict' amid a 'fragmented geopolitical order' (Vision of Humanity), underscoring the severity of this 100-point risk driver.",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "Despite sanctions, Russia's oil sector continues to adapt ('How the War and Latest Western Sanctions Are Impacting Russia\u2019s Oil Sector - Russia.Post'), indicating persistent, albeit managed, disruption rather than outright collapse, reflected in the score of 42.2.",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "Trade routes and supply chains are under immense pressure (score 80.3) due to escalating 'Sanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation' (Modern Diplomacy) and significant evasion, such as 'foreign cars flow[ing] to Russia through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions' (\u671d\u65e5\u65b0\u805e).",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "While the global economy demonstrates resilience, 'War, geopolitics, [and the] energy crisis' continue to exert pressure, forcing economies to 'evade every disaster' (The Economist) and contributing to a moderate 50.8 stress level on sovereign finances.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "The pervasive environment of 'economic warfare' through sanctions ('Sanctions are not a humane alternative to bombs. They are economic warfare - The Guardian') subtly contributes to currency volatility and liquidity concerns, evidenced by a 45.0 score.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "Sanctions are intensifying as 'economic warfare' (The Guardian) but are also driving fragmentation, with actors like China facilitating circumvention, seen in 'foreign cars flow[ing] to Russia through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions' (\u671d\u65e5\u65b0\u805e), pushing this score to 92.1.",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "The 'fragmented geopolitical order' (Vision of Humanity) and pervasive 'economic warfare' (The Guardian) implicitly heighten the risk of state-sponsored cyber-attacks targeting critical infrastructure as a tactical element of modern conflict, despite no direct headlines this cycle, leading to a score of 69.0.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "The 'geopolitics of resources' are a clear factor behind conflicts like Sudan\u2019s civil war (Eurasia Review), indicating that resource scarcity and environmental impacts are significant underlying drivers of instability, contributing to a substantial score of 80."
