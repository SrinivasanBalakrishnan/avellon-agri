    "AI_Brief": "The global risk landscape intensifies dramatically, with the Avellon Geopolitical Risk Index soaring to 73.8 and a velocity of +4.1, driven predominantly by a critical Geopolitical Conflict Intensity score of 100. The world grapples with a \"new face of conflict,\" as evidenced by Sudan's ongoing civil war amid a deeply fragmented geopolitical order (\"Vision of Humanity\"). This era is increasingly defined by \"economic warfare,\" where sanctions and tariffs have become primary weapons, displacing traditional military action. Trump's latest sanctions on Russian oil giants, designed to ratchet up economic pressure and end the Ukraine war (\"The New York Times,\" \"NPR\"), exemplify this shift, profoundly impacting Russia's vital oil sector (\"Russia.Post\") and pushing Energy & Maritime Disruption (42.2).\n\nThis aggressive use of economic tools, with G7 finance ministers discussing further sanctions and tariffs (\"Reuters\"), is exacerbating Trade & Supply Chain Stress, now at 81.0, as nations like China engage in their own \"sanctions gambit\" involving formal and informal economic coercion (\"AEI\"). The direct impact on global markets is palpable, influencing Sovereign Financial Stress (55.0) and Currency & Liquidity Pressure (45.0) as economies navigate these escalating tensions (\"U.S. Bank\"). This chaotic environment, now likened to \"Cold War Two\" by historians (\"The World Economic Forum\") and marked by \"Four Years of War in Europe\" (\"Foreign Policy\"), ensures that the interconnected web of conflict, energy crises, and economic uncertainty will continue to challenge global resilience, even as \"the economy evades every disaster\" (\"The Economist\"), maintaining high Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation (92.3).",

        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "The intensity of global conflict remains at its peak, marked by a \"fragmented geopolitical order.\" This is starkly highlighted by \"Unpacking the new face of conflict: Sudan\u2019s civil war amid a fragmented geopolitical order\" (Vision of Humanity), indicating widespread instability beyond traditional hotspots.",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "Disruption in the energy sector is significant, primarily driven by escalating economic measures. \"Trump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants in a push to end Ukraine war\" (NPR) directly impacts global energy flows and maritime routes, despite the score being moderate.",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "Trade networks are under considerable strain as tariffs and economic coercion become commonplace. \"China\u2019s Sanctions Gambit: Formal and Informal Economic Coercion in the Second Trade War\" (American Enterprise Institute - AEI) illustrates the growing weaponization of trade policy.",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "Geopolitical tensions are creating noticeable financial vulnerabilities for sovereign entities. \"Geopolitical conflict and its impact on global markets\" (U.S. Bank) underscores how ongoing wars and economic warfare pressure national finances.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "Global currencies and liquidity face moderate pressure amidst the volatile geopolitical landscape. \"War, geopolitics, energy crisis: how the economy evades every disaster\" (The Economist) reflects the underlying economic tremors caused by persistent instability.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "The global regulatory environment is highly fragmented, with sanctions emerging as a primary tool of statecraft. \"Sanctions are not a humane alternative to bombs. They are economic warfare\" (The Guardian) emphasizes the strategic use and broadening scope of these measures.",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "While not explicitly detailed, the evolving nature of global confrontation implies a heightened risk to digital and physical infrastructure. \"Sanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation: Are Trade Wars the New Warfare?\" (Modern Diplomacy) suggests a broader definition of warfare that includes non-kinetic attacks.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "The world continues to grapple with severe environmental and resource-related challenges. \"War, geopolitics, energy crisis: how the economy evades every disaster\" (The Economist) acknowledges the persistent \"energy crisis\" which points to broader resource shocks amplified by climate impacts."
