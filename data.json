    "AI_Brief": "The global stage is gripped by a surging tide of geopolitical conflict, registering an alarming score of 100, marking it as today's paramount risk driver. From the protracted 'Four Years of War in Europe' to Sudan's devastating civil war, described as 'the new face of conflict' amidst a 'fragmented geopolitical order,' the world is grappling with a landscape reminiscent of a 'Cold War Two.' This intense conflict is not just kinetic; it manifests as pervasive 'economic warfare,' with Western nations and figures like Trump escalating 'Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector' in a bid to end the Ukraine war. Yet, these sanctions lead to 'Trade Wars,' causing significant 'Trade & Supply Chain Stress' (79.8), as evidenced by 'foreign cars flow to Russia through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions,' highlighting supply chain resilience but also the complex circumvention of restrictions. This environment of heightened conflict and fragmentation casts a long shadow over global markets, increasing 'Sovereign Financial Stress' and exacerbating 'Climate & Resource Shocks' as conflicts like Sudan's are driven by 'The Geopolitics Of Resources.' The global economy, despite appearing to 'evade every disaster,' is navigating a perilous web of interconnected conflicts and economic hostilities.",

        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "Geopolitical conflict intensity is at its peak, scoring 100, driven by 'Four Years of War in Europe' and 'Sudan\u2019s civil war amid a fragmented geopolitical order.' This reflects a global landscape akin to 'Cold War Two,' where the nature of conflict is rapidly evolving.",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "Energy and maritime sectors face moderate disruption (42.2), primarily due to 'How the War and Latest Western Sanctions Are Impacting Russia\u2019s Oil Sector.' Further pressure comes from 'Trump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants,' impacting global energy flows and prices.",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "Trade and supply chain stress is high (79.8) as 'Sanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation: Are Trade Wars the New Warfare?' become commonplace. The 'EXCLUSIVE-Foreign cars flow to Russia through China, skirting Ukraine war sanctions' illustrates the ongoing challenge to traditional trade routes and compliance.",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "Sovereign financial stress remains a concern (55.0) as 'geopolitical conflict and its impact on global markets' creates volatility and uncertainty. The broad application of 'economic warfare,' including sanctions, places pressure on national budgets and financial stability globally.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "Currency and liquidity pressure is moderate (45.0), influenced by the broader context of 'economic warfare' and sanctions. The impact of 'Trump\u2019s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector' can induce market caution and affect the convertibility and value of currencies in targeted economies.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "Sanctions and regulatory fragmentation are extremely high (93.3), with numerous headlines highlighting their central role, such as 'Secondary Tariffs or Tighter Sanctions? Strategies to End Russia\u2019s War' and the declaration that 'Sanctions are not a humane alternative to bombs. They are economic warfare.' This indicates a highly complex and fragmented global regulatory environment.",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "Cyber and infrastructure threats are elevated (69.8) within the 'new face of conflict' emerging from a 'fragmented geopolitical order.' While specific incidents are not detailed, the nature of 'economic warfare' and modern geopolitical tension inherently encompasses these forms of aggression.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "Climate and resource shock is a significant concern (80), with 'Kordofan And Blue Nile\u2019s Quiet Battles: The Geopolitics Of Resources Behind Sudan\u2019s Civil War' explicitly linking conflict to resource scarcity. The broader 'War, geopolitics, energy crisis' also points to the vulnerability of essential resources."
