    "AI_Brief": "The global stage is gripped by a profound surge in geopolitical conflict intensity, reflected by an AGRI score of 71.2 and a top driver status. Fragmented conflicts, like Sudan's ongoing civil war (Vision of Humanity), showcase a chaotic international order where traditional conflict paradigms are shifting. This volatility is deeply intertwined with an escalating economic warfare, as demonstrated by President Trump's new sanctions on Russian oil giants (NPR, The New York Times). These punitive measures are not merely political tools; they are deemed 'economic warfare' by critics (The Guardian), signaling a new frontier in interstate competition where sanctions and tariffs (Modern Diplomacy, G7 discussions via Reuters) are as impactful as conventional arms. Such strategies invariably fuel trade and supply chain stress, as nations like China engage in their own 'sanctions gambit' (AEI), disrupting global commerce. The confluence of these factors pushes the world into what historian Niall Ferguson terms 'Cold War Two' (The World Economic Forum), a period where geopolitical machinations and economic leverage cascade into broad market instability, energy disruptions, and heightened financial anxieties across continents, proving that in today's landscape, the economy struggles to 'evade every disaster' (The Economist).",

    "Pillar_Narratives": {
        "Geopolitical Conflict Intensity": "The global landscape is defined by extreme conflict, with a score of 100, driven by the 'new face of conflict' exemplified by 'Sudan\u2019s civil war amid a fragmented geopolitical order' (Vision of Humanity) and 'Four Years of War in Europe' (Foreign Policy). This highlights a severe and widespread geopolitical instability.",
        "Energy & Maritime Disruption": "Despite a score of 42.2, significant disruption persists, as evidenced by 'Trump\u2019s Sanctions on Russian Oil Sector Ratchet Up Economic War' (The New York Times) and their impact on 'Russia\u2019s Oil Sector' (Russia.Post), directly influencing global energy supplies and pricing.",
        "Trade & Supply Chain Stress": "High stress is evident with a score of 79.0, fueled by the aggressive use of economic tools. 'China\u2019s Sanctions Gambit' (AEI) demonstrates how 'Sanctions, Tariffs, and Retaliation' (Modern Diplomacy) are increasingly used as 'new warfare,' disrupting established trade routes and supply chains.",
        "Sovereign Financial Stress": "With a score of 50.8, sovereign financial stability faces pressure as 'G7 finance ministers discuss possible sanctions, tariffs on supporters of Russia's war' (Reuters). This reflects a global effort to exert financial pressure on adversaries, creating broader market uncertainties and influencing national treasuries.",
        "Currency & Liquidity Pressure": "Despite a score of 45.0, underlying pressures persist due to the expanding 'economic warfare' framework. The imposition of new sanctions on Russia's oil sector (NPR) inevitably impacts international financial flows and the perceived stability of sanctioned currencies.",
        "Sanctions & Regulatory Fragmentation": "This pillar registers a critical score of 93.6, directly reflecting the widespread belief that 'Sanctions are not a humane alternative to bombs. They are economic warfare' (The Guardian). The proliferation of measures, such as 'Trump levies new sanctions on Russian oil giants' (NPR), fragments global regulatory landscapes and compliance.",
        "Cyber & Infrastructure Threats": "A score of 70.2 indicates heightened vulnerability, which is exacerbated by the ongoing shift towards 'new warfare' (Modern Diplomacy) in a 'Cold War Two' context (The World Economic Forum). This environment implicitly increases the likelihood of state-sponsored cyber-attacks and threats to critical infrastructure.",
        "Climate & Resource Shock": "A high score of 80 points to significant challenges, where the complex interplay of 'War, geopolitics, energy crisis' (The Economist) can intensify resource scarcity and redirect focus from climate mitigation efforts. The 'energy crisis' itself represents a significant resource shock."
